# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(h + n)

# Time Complexity:
# The DFS traversal takes O(n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since in the worst case, the DFS will visit every node.
# Constructing paths and finding the common prefix takes O(L) time, where L is the length of the paths.
# The overall time complexity is O(n+L), which simplifies to O(n) since L is at most n.
# Space Complexity:
# The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. 
# This is due to the recursive call stack in the DFS traversal.
# Additional space for storing paths is O(L), but since Lâ‰¤n, the overall space complexity is O(h+n).

# Approach:
# 1. Use DFS to find paths from the root to the start and destination nodes.
# 2. Compare the paths to find the common ancestor.
# 3. Replace the path from start to common ancestor with 'U' and append the path from the common ancestor to the destination.
